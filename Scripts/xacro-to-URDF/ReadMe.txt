Steps to convert Xacrofiles into URDF files.

Steps:
1. Remove any existing files and add all your xacro files into the folder 'urdf'.
2. Ensure that your xacro file containing the parent root is named 'origin.urdf'.
3. Run the script 'Convert xacro to URDF.bat' to generate the corresponding URDF file.
4. 'URDF_Generated.urdf' would be the name of the final URDF File. 

Note:
If the program is not generating a URDF, then it means that the macro file has some problems.
